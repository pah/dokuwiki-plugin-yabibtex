yabibtex Plugin for DokuWiki

Yet Another BibTeX plugin for DokuWiki

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:yabibtex

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/yabibtex/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.

The BibTeX handling in this plugin (see lib/ subdirectory) has been
ported from the Joomla! BibTeX plugin [1] to DokuWiki.  The DokuWiki
integration as well as the extended filtering and sorting options are
unique to this package.
